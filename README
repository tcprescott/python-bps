Python Blip Toolkit
===================

A toolkit for messing with Blip binary patch files. For more information on the
Blip patch format, see:

    http://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1506


Available Tools
===============

Included in this toolkit are a variety of tools useful to somebody wanting to
use Blip patches, or implementing Blip support on their own.

    blip-disasm FILENAME

	Reads the Blip patch in FILENAME and writes a human-readable
	disassembly of each operation to standard output.

    blip-asm FILENAME

	Reads the Blip patch disassembly in FILENAME (as generated by
	blip-disasm) and writes the binary Blip patch to standard output. You
	probably want to redirect the output to a file.

    blip-validate FILENAME

	Reads the Blip patch in FILENAME and performs a number of checks to
	make sure it's a valid patch. In particular, it checks for things like
	"does the patch try to read past the beginning or end of the source or
	target files" and "does the patch try to write past the end of the
	target file". If it does find a problem, you'll probably want to
	examine the patch contents with blip-disasm.

	If an error is found, a description is printed to standard error and it
	exits with a non-zero exit code. Otherwise, it generates no output.

    blip-optimize FILENAME

	Reads the Blip patch in FILENAME, performs some optimization
	transformations on it, and writes the resulting binary Blip patch to
	standard output.

    blip-apply SOURCEFILE TARGETFILE PATCHFILE

	Reads the source file in SOURCEFILE and applies the patch operations in
	PATCHFILE to produce TARGETFILE.

    blip-diff SOURCEFILE TARGETFILE

	Compares the data in the given files and writes a binary Blip patch
	that will transform SOURCEFILE into TARGETFILE to standard output. It's
	not currently very smart, and errs on the side of choosing operations
	that blip-optimize can clean up.
